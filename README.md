### Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My coding life started out with Excel and the wonderful world of macros. I have years of on-the-job experience with VBA, SQL, and database operations. I love working through mental challenges, and also reverse-engineering others' solutions and adapting them for my own purposes. As former linguist, I've already adopted an affection for life-long learning. I enjoy coding because I know I will always remain a student, no matter how many years I study.
